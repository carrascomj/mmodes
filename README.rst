mmodes (Metabolic Models based Ordinary Differential Equations Simulation)
#########################

Metabolic Models based Ordinary Differential Equations Simulation
-------------
The package provides an straight-forward framework to run dynamic simulations
of metabolic models consortia using coprapy and scipy.

Installation
-------------
On a Linux shell:
  $ cd path_to_mmodes/mmodes; sudo python3 setup.py install

Example script simulation
-------------
An example.py with one strain is provided on "example.py"
I recommend to work on a virtualenv since the package uses the latest python3
versions of the modules required.
